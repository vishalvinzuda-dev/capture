/**
 * Hairline Riffle — a tray of eight isometric cards that answers the pointer.
 * The card under the pointer stands up and lifts; the ones in front lean
 * forward and the ones behind lean back, staggered outwards from it on a
 * 700ms lift curve. Hover or use the arrow keys to pull a card; Escape puts
 * it back. The stage is a focusable group with an accessible live-region
 * caption naming the card pulled.
 *
 * Ported from @lucasmarkes/hairline's react.tsx adapter (MIT, © 2026 Lucas
 * Marques), scoped to the Riffle figure only: a component renders one empty
 * `<div>` and mounts the figure on it in a layout effect, so on the server
 * the box is there and the drawing is not. It mounts once: a changed option
 * reaches the running figure through `update`, and `onRead` is read through
 * a ref so an inline function never remounts it.
